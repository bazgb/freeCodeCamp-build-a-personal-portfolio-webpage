# freeCodeCamp Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

Note: this is a joke project, a portfolio for a coder who I made up for a laugh. Ths is because I had no need to build my own personal portfolio, as I already have my own website to serve that purpose. Hopefully the humour in this project is self-explanatory, but sometimes you can't be sure so I wanted to be clear!

**Skills practiced:**

- HTML
- CSS
- Media queries
- Google Fonts
- SVG Patterns
