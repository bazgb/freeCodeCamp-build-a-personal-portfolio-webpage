    <h3>About (the man, the legend)</h3>
    <p>"Probably the world's best coder" - Steve Jobs</p>
    <p>"If I hadn't invented Windows first, he definitely would have beaten me to it" - Bill Gates</p>
    <p>I'm an amazing coder, who knows all the languages. In fact I've even stopped respondng to any messages from
      friends or family unless they're formatted as fully standards-compliant JSON.</p>
    <p>If you need anything built to a world-class standard, then get in touch. I'm happy to take on brand-new
      projects, and equally happy to jump into existing projects and explain why they're not up to my own high
      standards yet. But they will be, if you can afford me that is.</p>

      <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon - wouldn't be where they are today without me. They know this, so they gave me
